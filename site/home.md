### Before You Use the Checklist
It’s important to understand that just using OpenGates will not magically prevent gatekeeping or toxicity in your content. You and your team will need to make conscious efforts to work on the items on the list.

As a developer and a content creator, it is _your job_ to make sure that **every** piece of content you put out is inclusive, welcoming, and accessible to all. This checklist is here to make your life easier. No longer will you need to remember every single thing you need to do in order to stop accidental gatekeeping of CodeNewbies and newer programmers when creating and building.

Do know that depending on what you are building, some of the list items may not apply.
